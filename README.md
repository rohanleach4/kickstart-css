# Kickstart CSS for Prototype Development

This is a Kickstarter for a CSS theme that can be used for rapid prototypes. Only HTML5 semantic elements are used.

This repro uses HTML5 Boilerplate for its structure. The only file needed is:

 css/kickstarter.css

add this to the top of your css file or include it in your html file.

## Getting Started

This repro allows rapid development of protoypes by omitting the need of classes or styles and only requiring semantic elements.
Your code should be wrapped in a main element
```html
<main>
	<section>
		// sematic elements and content here
	</section>
</main>
```
