# Kickstart CSS for Prototype Development

This is a Kickstarter for a CSS theme that can be used for rapid prototypes. Only HTML5 semantic elements are used.

This repro uses HTML5 Boilerplate for its structure and takes advantage of its normalize.css and main.css
These can be found in the css folder.

## Getting Started

This repro allows rapid development of protoypes by omitting the need of classes or styles and only requiring semantic elements.
Your code should be wrapped in a main element
```html
<main>
	<section>
		// sematic elements and content here
	</section>
</main>
```
